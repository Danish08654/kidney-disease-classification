# kidney-disease-classification
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting kidney disease using clinical and laboratory data.
It demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

The goal is to build a baseline classification model that can assist in early
risk identification of kidney disease.
